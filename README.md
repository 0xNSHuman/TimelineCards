## Installation
### CocoaPods ([wtf is that?](https://cocoapods.org/about))
1. Add `pod 'TimelineCards'` to your `Podfile`;
2. Then run `pod update` in Terminal;
3. Re-open your project using `.xcworkspace`, put `import TimelineCards` in the swift files you plan to create awesome cards from (or use bridging in Obj-C projects);
4. Rebuild and enjoy.

### Old School Way
Drop folder with `.swift` source files to your project. Done.

## Usage
### TL;DR

Go to Demo project, it has a lot of things demonstrated! If you get confused with anything, you're welcome to continue reading.

### Single Card

Cards in **TimelineCards** kit are highly customizable views that present ordered set of data. They were designed to describe events or milestones, but nothing prevents you from using them for different purposes, given that every element can have unlimited complexity.

Cards support elements grouping, although current version doesn't support recursively nested groups (~~and probably never will~~).

</p>

#### Creation
If you want to present a single static timeline — `TimelineCard` object is just what you need. Let's create it:

```Swift
// Let's say you want card to be 80% of its superview's width
let timelineWidth: CGFloat = view.bounds.width * 0.8

let demoCard = TimelineCard(width: timelineWidth)
demoCard.dataProvider = self
demoCard.eventsHandler = self
view.addSubview(demoCard) // Calls `reloadData()` implicitly

// Optionally
demoCard.reloadData()
```
Height of the card will be calculated automatically based on its data source, and available after `reloadData()` method execution, or after card is added to superview.

#### Customization

The creation code above is enough for a simple card with neutral (but nice) appearance to work. Nevertheless, card appearance can be customized in a number of ways. Here are some examples:

```Swift
demoCard.backgroundColor = .white
demoCard.borderAppearance = (.orange, 2.0) // color and width
demoCard.cornerRadius = 20.0
demoCard.lineColor = .darkGray
demoCard.itemShapeHeight = 30.0 // basically diameter of milestone "circle" thing
demoCard.timelinePathWidth = 2.0 // width of drawn timeline itself
demoCard.margins = (20, 10, 20, 10) // css-like notation
```

You can also set card **header** and **footer** to be any custom `UIView` you'd like. Card will update its layout accordingly.

```Swift
let header = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: detailsCard.bounds.width, height: 60))
header.backgroundColor = .purple
demoCard.headerView = header

let footer = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: detailsCard.bounds.width, height: 100))
footer.backgroundColor = .purple
demoCard.footerView = footer
```

As soon as you make any of the above updates, card rebuilds itself automatically. It you want to rule this process manually (saves resources), just turn this feature off:

```Swift
demoCard.autoreload = false
```

#### Data Source and Events Handling

First, make your data provider comply with `TimelineCardDataProvider` and `TimelineCardEventsHandler` protocols by adding them to corresponding class declaration.

##### Implementing `TimelineCardDataProvider`

Now, let's send some data to your card when it requests so. You do this by creating array consisting of `TimelineItem` and/or `TimelineItemGroup` objects, which are the main data units that you use in **TimelineCards** kit. They both comply with `TimelineSourceElement` protocol — type that you must return in result.

```Swift
func elementsForTimelineCard(_ timelineCard: TimelineCard, containerWidth: CGFloat) -> [TimelineSourceElement] {
	var cardSource = [] as [TimelineSourceElement]

	for someData in myDataModel.objects {
		if someData.isGroup {
			var childTimelineItems = [TimelineItem]()
			for childData in someData.children {
				let timelineItem = TimelineItem(...)
				childTimelineItems.append(timelineItem)
			}

			let timelineItemGroup = TimelineItemGroup(...)
			cardSource.append(timelineItemGroup)
		} else {
			let timelineItem = TimelineItem(...)
			cardSource.append(timelineItem)
		}
	}

	return cardSource
}
```

*Note: `containerWidth` gives you info about width of containers that your custom item description views will be added to. Anything beyound this width limit will be invisible.*

There are two options of creating `TimelineItem` and `TimelineItemGroup`.

1. Using simple preset with only **Title** and **Subtitle** to be shown for item. You can still affect their appearance because you send attributed strings as parameters:

```Swift
let attrubitedTitle = NSAttributedString(string: "Event title", attributes: [.foregroundColor : UIColor.white])
let attrubitedSubTitle = NSAttributedString(string: "Event subtitle", attributes: [.foregroundColor : UIColor.white])

let simpleItemOne = TimelineItem(title: attrubitedTitle, subtitle: attrubitedSubTitle, icon: UIImage(named: "icon.png"))

let simpleItemTwo = TimelineItem(title: simpleItemOne, subtitle: attrubitedSubTitle, icon: UIImage(named: "icon.png"))

// And, if you want them to be part of the group
let groupItem = TimelineItemGroup(title: attrubitedTitle, subtitle: attrubitedSubTitle, items: [simpleItemOne, simpleItemTwo], icon: UIImage(named: "icon.png"))
```

2. Using custom view of any height (but limited to `containerWidth`) to describe item in the way you want:

```Swift
let itemDescView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: containerWidth, height: 65.0))
itemDescView.backgroundColor = .lightGray
// Customize it the way you want!

let simpleItemOne = TimelineItem.init(customView: itemDescView, icon: UIImage(named: "icon.png"))

let simpleItemTwo = TimelineItem.init(customView: itemDescView, icon: UIImage(named: "sub_icon.png"))

// And, if you want them to be part of the group
let groupItem = TimelineItemGroup(customView: itemDescView, items: [simpleItemOne, simpleItemTwo], icon: UIImage(named: "sub_icon.png"))
```

This way you build array of uniquely customized items for the card.

##### Implementing `TimelineCardEventsHandler`

This one is pretty straight-forward ans self-describing. You just use thise methods to handle events from cards:

```Swift
func didSelectElement(at index: Int, in timelineCard: TimelineCard)

func didSelectSubElement(at index: (Int, Int), in timelineCard: TimelineCard)

func didTouchHeaderView(_ headerView: UIView, in timelineCard: TimelineCard)

func didTouchFooterView(_ footerView: UIView, in timelineCard: TimelineCard)
```

<hr>

### Feed of Cards

Cards Feed is represented by `TimelineFeed` view, which is basically a vertical scroll of `TimelineCard` objects. It uses `UITableView` internally to offer memory-efficient reusability, which makes it possible to build feed consisting of large amount of cards.

<p>
<img width="30%" height="auto" alt="Card Feed" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladaverin24/TimelineCards/master/Screenshots/feed.PNG" />
</p>

#### Creation
Initialize new `TimelineFeed` object and set its `dataSource` and `delegate`:

```Swift
let timelineWidth: CGFloat = view.bounds.width * 0.8

let timelineFeed = TimelineFeed(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: view.bounds.width * 0.8, height: view.bounds.height))
timelineFeed.center = view.center

timelineFeed.dataSource = self
timelineFeed.delegate = self

// Optional customization options
timelineFeed.paddingBetweenCards = 20.0
timelineFeed.topMargin = 20.0
timelineFeed.bottomMargin = 20.0

view.addSubview(timelineFeed)
timelineFeed.reloadData()
```

#### Data Source and Events Handling

Make your data provider comply with `TimelineFeedDataSource` and `TimelineFeedDelegate` protocols by adding them to corresponding class declaration.

##### Implementing `TimelineFeedDataSource`

Start with method that tells feed how many cards you want it to present:

```Swift
func numberOfCards(in timelineFeed: TimelineFeed) -> Int {
	return timelinesCollection.items.count
}
```

Now, let's initialize new card every time feed asks us to for given index:

```Swift
func card(at index: Int, in timelineFeed: TimelineFeed) -> TimelineCard {
	let timelineCard = TimelineCard(width: timelineFeed.bounds.width)
	// Customize as you'd do with Single Card
	return timelineCard
}
```
**Note**: *DO NOT set `dataProvider` or `eventHandler` for `TimelineCard` object here. `TimelineFeed` is responsible for this*.

Good! Now, whenever particular card is about to be reused in feed, it will kindly ask you to provide data for it. This is very similar to what we did for a Single Card. Just create some `TimelineSourceElement`s:

```Swift
func elementsForTimelineCard(at index: Int, containerWidth: CGFloat) -> [TimelineSourceElement] {
	var elements = [] as [TimelineSourceElement]

	// Creating those `TimelineItem` and/or `TimelineItemGroup` objects..

	return elements
}
```

Ok, cards are set up and running smoothly, but you can also add headers on top of any card, so that we can keep track of this endless scrolling madness. As for many other features, you have two options here.

1. Keep it simple and use attributed **Title** and **Subtitle** preset (or just **Title** if you want to keep it minimal):

```Swift
func titleAndSubtitle(at index: Int, in timelineFeed: TimelineFeed) -> (NSAttributedString, NSAttributedString?)? {

	let timelineData = timelinesCollection.items[index]

	let testTitle = NSAttributedString(string: "Timeline Card #\(index)", attributes: [.foregroundColor : UIColor.white, .font : UIFont(name: "HelveticaNeue-Bold", size: 23.0)])

	let testSubtitle = NSAttributedString(string: "Subtitle text", attributes: [.foregroundColor : UIColor.white])

	return (testTitle, testSubtitle)

	// Subtitle is optional
	//return (testTitle, nil)
}
```

2. Use custom `UIView`:

```Swift
func headerViewForCard(at index: Int, in timelineFeed: TimelineFeed) -> UIView? {
	let customHeader = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: timelineFeed.bounds.width, height: 60.0))
	customHeader.backgroundColor = .purple
	return customHeader
}
```

##### Implementing `TimelineFeedDelegate`

Fairly simple and similar to event handling for a Single Card. The difference is that you get index of the card where event did occur.

```Swift
func didSelectElement(at index: Int, timelineCardIndex: Int)

func didSelectSubElement(at index: (Int, Int), timelineCardIndex: Int)

func didTouchHeaderView(_ headerView: UIView, timelineCardIndex: Int)

func didTouchFooterView(_ footerView: UIView, timelineCardIndex: Int)
```
